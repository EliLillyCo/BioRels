Protein expression score is based on immunohistochemical data manually scored with regard to staining intensity (negative, weak, moderate or strong) 
and fraction of stained cells (<25%, 25-75% or >75%). 
Each combination of intensity and fractions is automatically converted into an protein expression level score as follows: 
<ul><li>Not detected:
	<ul><li>negative</li>
		 <li>weak &lt;25% </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Low:
	<ul><li>weak combined with either 25 - 75% or 75%</li>
		 <li>moderate  &lt;25%</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Medium:
	<ul><li>moderate combined with either 25 - 75% or 75%</li>
		 <li>strong &lt;25% </li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>High:
	<ul><li>medium, strong combined with either 25 - 75% or 75%</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	</ul>In addition to this, protein expression values are manually adjusted as necessary when evaluated by our expert annotators. 
<br/>
<p>A reliability score is set manually for all genes and indicates the level of reliability of the analyzed protein expression pattern based on available protein/RNA/gene characterization data from both HPA and the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database.
The overall score encompass several factors: reproducibility of the antibody staining in different cell lines (and if signal strength correlates with RNA expression levels); assays for enhanced antibody validation by using antibodies binding to different epitopes on the same target protein (independent antibodies), by knockdown/knockout of the target protein (genetic methods) and by matching of the signal with a GFP-tagged protein (recombinant expression); experimental evidence for location described in literature. Considerations are also made on whether the antibody performs in non IF-related methods like Western blot or immunohistochemistry.
</p>
The final score leads to the assignment into one of the following four classes:
<ul>
<li>Enhanced - One or more antibodies are enhanced validated and there is no contradicting data, for example literature describes experimental evidence for a different location.</li>
<li>Supported - There is no enhanced validation of the used antibody, but the annotated localization is reported in literature.</li>
<li>Approved - If the localization of the protein has not been previously described and was detected by only one antibody without additional antibody validation.</li>
<li>Uncertain - If the antibody-staining pattern contradicts experimental data or no expression is detected on the RNA level.</li>
