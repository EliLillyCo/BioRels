# Welcome to the Eli Lilly BioRels (BIOlogical RELationshipS) implementation 

## Background
BioRels is a library for any scientist involved in drug discovery, biology or chemistry. 
This repository contains all the scripts and configuration files necessary for you to build
a database aggregating the public data of up to 32 data sources.

The [documentation file](DOCS/Biorels_Complete_documentation.docx) will provides you will all the necessary information to configure, run, take advantage of, and expand upon it.

## REQUIREMENTS:

BioRels will require the following:
* An enabled PostGreSQL server (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 
* Server path, port, and connection information for the PostGreSQL server
* Singularity-CE
* Disk space:
  * 1 to 2Tb preferably - Depends highly on the data sources.
  * Up to 50 Tb if all data sources are required
* Computing power:
  * SGE Cluster
  * OR single cpu (experimental)
  * Cloud computing with Nextflow coming soon


## Quickstart

If you want to evaluate BioRels with the minimal amount of configuration, please go to [QUICKSTART](BACKEND/INSTALL/QUICKSTART/README.md)

## INSTALLATION:

Please follow the guidelines provided in the documentation file.
