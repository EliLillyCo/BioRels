# Welcome to the Eli Lilly BioRels (BIOlogical RELationshipS) implementation 

## Background
Welcome to Biorels! We're excited to introduce you to a dynamic platform designed to empower you with the best resources from the scientific community in biological sciences. Our mission is to make it easy for you to access a wealth of data from scientific publications, patents, clinical trials, and various databases. Biorels is not just about simplifying data access; it’s about fostering collaboration and innovation by creating a shared space for scientists to build upon existing knowledge.

Our platform consists of two main components: a flexible backend infrastructure and a user-friendly website. The backend allows you to select amond the 30 data sources below and store only the data you need, giving you the freedom to develop your projects privately. Meanwhile, our website is modular and visually intuitive, making it easy to explore and analyze data. We also offer different levels of security and access to cater to enterprise needs. Join us in transforming the way we connect with and utilize biological data!
