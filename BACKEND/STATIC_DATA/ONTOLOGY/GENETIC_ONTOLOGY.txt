NAME	Mendelian inheritance
DESCRIP	A mode of inheritance of diseases whose pathophysiology can be traced back to variants in a single gene. The inheritance patterns of these single-gene (monogenic) diseases are often referred to as Mendelian in honor of Gregor Mendel.

NAME	Autosomal dominant inheritance
CR_DATE	2024/02/21
DESCRIP	A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to a alleles encoded on one of the autosomes (i.e., the human chromosomes 1-22) in which a trait manifests in heterozygotes. In the context of medical genetics, an autosomal dominant disorder is caused when a single copy of the mutant allele is present. Males and females are affected equally, and can both transmit the disorder with a risk of 50% for each child of inheriting the mutant allele.

DESCRIP	A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to an allele encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Because the mitochondrial genome is essentially always maternally inherited, a mitochondrial condition can only be transmitted by females, although the condition can affect both sexes. The proportion of mutant mitochondria can vary (heteroplasmy).
